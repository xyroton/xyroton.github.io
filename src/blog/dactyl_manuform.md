The Dactyl Manuform is a DIY ortholinear split keyboard with a keywell. In the following I will describe the experience of building and using it.

# Design Choices and how they Feel
Explain why we mention everything
## Split
As the name suggests, it splits the keyboard in half  shown in the image below.

This makes it possible to position each keyboard half where it feels most comfortable for you. Generally you would want to place the keyboard halves relative to your shoulder width apart to allow for an open shoulder and back position. This simultaneously also allows for a natural wrist position, by now not having to bend your wrist outward anymore as.



This is generally understood as the biggest selling point of a split keyboard. 

## Ortholinear
Traditional keyboards have a staggered  key arrangement. Which means keys are not vertically aligned (see image below).

This will lead to unnecessary left and right motion when typing and moving between rows.
This extra effort will be eliminated on ortholinear keyboard, since it allows your fingers to travel up and down in a straight line without having these micro left and right motions.
Side Note: Ortholinear really only makes sense on a split keyboard, since on a normal but ortholinear Keyboard one would need to bend ones wrists quite heavily in order to be able to move the fingers in a straight line  up and down. 

## Keywell
Some people treat this as a gimmick (most likely because they have never actually typed a Keyboard with one), but let me tell you it is not. Even if you have not yet fully learned to  type on it you will be able to tell the difference. For one, the distance to move from one row to the next become smaller, and secondly the change of motion is not as noticeable/none existent. By that I mean, for instance, moving you finger from the home row on a traditional keyboard (is the row where your fingers naturally rest on the f and j key) to one row above it (R3) to press a key there. That requires you to move you finger forward over the key and then change to a downward motion in order to press it.
On a keyboard with a keywell this motion somewhat combines into one, where to press a key one row above the home row, it is more matter of only pushing your finger forward without now having to switch to a full downward motion again.
Also note that the columns have a different height. For example the pinky row sits higher then the ring finger, to compensate for it beings shorter then other fingers. In addition, the columns shift slightly forward or backwards depending on the corresponding finger . 

## Thumb Cluster
In fairness I have to say that I can only share my opinion about the default 6 key thumb cluster, since there are different variations of thumb clusters, and that is the only one with which I have personal experience. So the following might be completely invalid for other thumb cluster designs. Although one thing they all have in common is, that they are not flat. Instead the thumb cluster falls down inwards and therefor one is pressing the keys not fully with the side of the thumb but also partially with the thumb pad. The motion itself becomes now more of a grabbing than a slapping down motion. This is particularly nice if one is typing with floating hands because this makes it easy to press the keys from different angles, but it can make the use a bit more difficult in combination with a palm rest. 
With all that said, I am not a big fan of the thumb cluster, simply due to misplacement of the two primary keys. Neither of them is in a comfortable enough spot to serve as a primary action key for me, such as space bar. The comfort zone would be right in between those two.
Though that problem could be evaded by simply picking a different thumb cluster to begin with, or by changing the thumb key positions manually in the configurator. More about that later.

## Tenting
Means your keyboard is not sitting flat on the table. Instead each keyboard half is slightly elevated, allowing you to type with you hands in a slightly outward rotated position. This is also the natural resting positions of your hands which you can check by standing up straight and letting your arms hang relaxed on the side. As you will observe, your palms will not face fully backwards.
