The Dactyl Manuform is a DIY ortholinear split keyboard with a keywell. In the following I will describe the experience of building and using it.

# Design Choices and how they Feel
Explain why we mention everything
## Split
As the name suggests, it splits the keyboard in half. This makes it possible to position each keyboard half where it feels most comfortable for you. Generally you would want to place the keyboard halves relative to your shoulder width apart to allow for an open shoulder and back position. This simultaneously also allows for a natural wrist position, by now not having to bend your wrist outward anymore as shown in the image below.

This is generally understood as the biggest selling point of a split keyboard. 

## Ortholinear
Traditional keyboards have a staggered  key arrangement. Which means keys are not vertically aligned (see image below). 
This will lead to unnecessary left and right motion when typing and moving between rows.
This extra effort will be eliminated on ortholinear keyboard, since it allows your fingers to travel up and down in a straight line without having these micro left and right motions.
Side Note: Ortholinear really only makes sense on a split keyboard, since on a normal but ortholinear Keyboard one would need to bend ones wrists quite heavily in order to be able to move the fingers in a straight line  up and down. 

## Keywell
Some people treat this as a gimmick (most likely because they have never actually typed a Keyboard with one), but let me tell you it is not. Even if you have not yet fully learned to  type on it you will be able to tell the difference. For one, the distance to move from one row to the next become smaller, and secondly the change of motion is not as noticeable/none existent. By that I mean, for instance, moving you finger from the home row on a traditional keyboard (is the row where your fingers naturally rest on the f and j key) to one row above it (R3) to press a key there. That requires you to move you finger forward over the key and then change to a downward motion in order to press it.
On a keyboard with a keywell this motion somewhat combines into one, where to press a key one row above the home row again
