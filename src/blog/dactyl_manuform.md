The Dactyl Manuform is a DIY ortholinear split keyboard with a keywell. In the following I will describe the experience of building and using it.

# Design choices and how they feel
Explain why we mention everything
## Why Split?
As the name suggests, it splits the keyboard in half. This makes it possible to position each keyboard half where it feels most comfortable for you. Generally you would want to place the keyboard halves relative to your shoulder width apart to allow for an open shoulder and back position. This simultaneously also allows for a natural wrist position, by now not having to bend your wrist outward anymore as shown in the image below.

This is generally understood as the biggest selling point of a split keyboard. 

## Ortholinear
Traditional keyboards have a staggerd  key arragement. Which means keys are not vertically alligned (see image below). 
This will lead to uneccesary left and right motion when typing and moving between rows.
This extra effort will be eliminated on ortholinear keyboard, since it allows your fingers to travel up and down in a straight line without having these micro left and right motions.
Side Note: Ortholinear really only makes sense on a split keyboard, since on a normal but ortholinear Keyboard one would need to bend ones wrists quite heavely in order to be able to move the fingers in a straight line. up and down.
