Hereâ€™s how I write and manage my notes and sync them between different devices on Linux without depending on services like Notion.

The setup is simple:
- I write notes in [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/)
- I sync notes across devices with [**Syncthing**](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Syncthing)
- I back them up and version them using [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) and [**GitHub**](https://github.com/)

> **Note:** My system uses `systemd` (which is usually the default on most systems). If you're using something else you'll need to adapt the relevant parts.

 

# Obsidian

Obsidian is a Markdown-based note-taking app with a strong community and a big plugin ecosystem. Itâ€™s free (not open source), and all your notes are plain `.md` files stored locally â€” no forced cloud syncs.

## Install Obsidian (Arch Linux)
```bash title="Terminal"
sudo pacman -S obsidian
```

If you're new to Obsidian, the [help docs](https://help.obsidian.md/) are pretty useful to get started.

 

# Syncthing

To keep notes synced between devices (like your phone and laptop), I use Syncthing. It works over LAN, and you control everything.

## Install Syncthing
```bash title="Terminal"
sudo pacman -S syncthing
```

## Enable and Start the Service
```bash title="Terminal"
sudo systemctl enable --now syncthing@<user>.service
```

> Replace `<user>` with your actual username.

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:8384](http://127.0.0.1:8384) in your browser â€” this is the Syncthing web UI.

## Mobile Syncing
Install the Syncthing app on Android or iOS to sync your notes to your phone.

## Firewall (if devices can't connect)
If you're using [UFW](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Uncomplicated_Firewall), run:
```bash title="Terminal"
sudo ufw allow syncthing
```

If youâ€™re not using UFW, a quick Google search will help you figure it out ðŸ¤—.

 

# Git & GitHub Backup

Syncthing handles syncing, but it doesnâ€™t track changes. Thatâ€™s where Git comes in. With Git, you get **version history** and we will use GitHub to host the git repo to be able to access it from anywhere.

## Install Git
```bash title="Terminal"
sudo pacman -S git
```

## Create a GitHub Repo
If you donâ€™t already have a GitHub account, nowâ€™s the time. Create a private repo for your notes and clone it locally.
- Then create a new folder inside the GitHub repo we just cloned.
- In Obsidian, set that folder (not the root of the repo itself) as your vault.
 

# Automating Git Commits

You could manually `git commit` and `git push` your changes every dayâ€¦ but that can be labour intensive. Letâ€™s automate it.

## Write a Commit Script

Create this script at `~/.local/bin/git_auto_commit.sh`:

```js showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

export HOME=/home/<user>
git config --global --add safe.directory /home/<user>/<git-repo>

cd /home/<user>/<git-repo> || exit

git add .
git commit -m "Auto-commit $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')"
git push origin main
```

Make sure to replace:
- `<user>` with your actual Linux username
- `<git-repo>` with the folder name of your GitHub repo

Make it executable:
```bash title="Terminal"
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/git_auto_commit.sh
```

## Add `.local/bin` to PATH (if needed)

Check if it's already in your `$PATH`:
```bash title="Terminal"
echo "$PATH" | grep -q "$HOME/.local/bin" && echo "You're good!" || echo "Need to add it."
```

> If not, add it to your shell config:
> 
> ### For Bash:
> ```bash title="Terminal"
> echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
> ```
> 
> ### For Zsh:
> ```bash title="Terminal"
> echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
> ```

 

# systemd Automation

Weâ€™ll create a `systemd` timer that runs the script every 2 hours.

## Create the Service

Create this file:  
`/etc/systemd/system/git_auto_commit.service`

e.g. with neovim `sudo nvim /etc/systemd/system/git_auto_commit.service`

```ini showLineNumbers
[Unit]
Description=Git Auto Commit Service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
User=<user>
ExecStart=/home/<user>/.local/bin/git_auto_commit.sh
```

## Create the Timer

Create this file:  
`/etc/systemd/system/git_auto_commit.timer`

e.g. with neovim `sudo nvim /etc/systemd/system/git_auto_commit.timer`

```ini showLineNumbers
[Unit]
Description=Run git_auto_commit.service every 2 hours

[Timer]
OnBootSec=10min
OnUnitActiveSec=2h

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

## Enable the Timer

Reload `systemd` and start the timer:

```bash title="Terminal"
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now git_auto_commit.timer
```

You can check the timerâ€™s status with:
```bash title="Terminal"
systemctl status git_auto_commit.timer
```

And see logs with:
```bash title="Terminal"
journalctl -u git_auto_commit.service
```

To test it manually:
```bash title="Terminal"
sudo systemctl start git_auto_commit.service
```

 

# Final Thoughts

Thatâ€™s it! With this setup you get:

- [x] Local-first note-taking  
- [x] Syncing across all your devices  
- [x] Automatic version control

With this setup no one will be able to hold your notes hostage. If you have ideas to improve this setup, or if something doesnâ€™t work as expected, feel free to reach out.
